                <h2>Goal of Hospitalization</h2>
            <p>The main goal of being admitted is:
                <ul>
                    <li id="important">To restore or improve health so that people can return home
                        Thus, hospital stays are intended to be relatively short and to enable people to be safely discharged to home or to another health care setting where treatment can be completed.</li>
                    <li id="important">For many people, hospital admission begins with a visit to the emergency department. Knowing when and how to go to an emergency department is important. When people do go to the emergency department, they should bring their medical information.</li>
                    <li id="important">Children may require a parent or other caregiver to stay at the hospital most of the time.</li>   
                </ul> 
            </p>
